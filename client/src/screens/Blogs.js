          ≡) Chinese Group To Establish EV Plant In Pakistan
        </h4 >
        <br></br>
        <p>
          Giving a good news for the future of Electric Vehicles (EV) in Pakistan, a China-based Gauss Auto Group has announced to set up an electric vehicle (EV) manufacturing plant in Pakistan. The company will set up the plant in Karachi port’s Special Economic Zone (SEZ) on almost 1,000 acres of land.
          As per a press statement from the company, it would be a joint venture with AKD Group and Holdings. The statement read that Gauss Auto focuses on the innovation and development of automobiles and the integration of resources. “The company is registered in Silicon Valley, US while its operations are in Shanghai, China,” the company said.
          During a visit to the Board of Investment (BoI), CEO Gauss Auto Group and CEO AKD Group Holding met and discussed the related issues with Federal Minister BoI Chaudhry Salik Hussain and Secretary BoI Fareena Mazhar. Both groups also expressed their intentions to export their locally-assembled EVs from Pakistan.

          ≡) Mercedes Just Sold Most EXPENSIVE Car Ever
        </h4 >
        <br></br>
        <p>
          The subject car is a 1955 Mercedes 300 SLR “Uhlenhaut Coupe. ” The word “Uhlenhaut” refers to Rudolf Uhlenhaut, the creator and chief engineer for Mercedes, and the car was also his brainchild. The 300 SLR Uhlenhaut Coupe is one of the most exciting and iconic cars and has a historical significance.
          The 300SLR Uhlenhaut is the hardtop Coupe version and is basically based on the open-top 2-seater 300 SLR W196-S. W196-S was a race car and won every single race back in 1955. SLR is short for Sport Light Racing . Meanwhile, W196-S was derived from W196-R, a Formula One car for the 1954 and 1955 seasons, and won 9 out of 12 races. All the three, W196-R, W196-S/300SLR [Open Top], and the 300SLR Coupe, were designed & engineered by Rudolf Uhlenhaut.        </p>

          ≡) Complete Ban On CBU Car Imports ❌
        </h4 >
        <br></br>
        <p>
          The government has banned the import of all used and new CBU (Completely Built-Up) cars under the SRO598. Only commercial vehicles import will be allowed. No more luxury or passenger vehicles to enter the country’s borders.
          The ban will also affect the already booked cars with delivery times later than May 19, 2022. Only the vehicles that have reached the Karachi port will be cleared and delivered to the customers.

          ≡) What If We Have The Latest Hyundai Santro In Pakistan?
        </h4 >
        <br></br>
        <p>
          From 1999 to 2009, we saw two versions of the first generation Santro (pre-facelift and post-facelift) on the roads. The Hyundai hatchback left the Pakistani market in 2010 and hasn’t made a comeback since.
          The first generation Santro’s build quality and features were miles ahead of Mehran, Alto, Cuore, and Cultus of that time. And guess what? The second generation Santro is even better. If Hyundai launches the latest generation of Santro in Pakistan, it will crush the ongoing models of Cultus, Wagon R, and even Picanto. Don’t believe us? Just watch!

        <p>
          Safeer’s Yamaha 125 dragged Zille’s Honda 125 and settled the battle. This tug of war proves that Yamaha YB125Z DX is a more stable and planted bike than Honda CG 125. That being said, if we compete the two bikes in a race, Honda CG 125 will run faster than Yamaha YB125Z DX.

          ≡) “Don’t Buy Range Rover” – Owner Protested Outside Dealership
        </h4 >
        <br></br>
        <p>
          Meanwhile, if we talk about Range Rover Vogue’s experience in Pakistan, our very own Suneel Munj had a similar experience. In one of the owner’s reviews in 2018, he told us that had the car since 2012, and out of those six years, the car remained in the workshop for four years. “I have replaced its engine and transmission twice,” he told us. He added the drive experience of this car is excellent, but its maintenance is way too expensive. “It keeps the owner worried all the time,” he stated.
          So, in short, our and international experience of Rover Vogue is similar, meaning it has a very high maintenance cost. And after buying such an expensive car, this much maintenance is unjustified. If an individual is spending so much, he automatically expects some executive experience but with this car, it is not the case.

          ≡) Who Are Better Drivers? Lefties Or Righties?
        </h4 >
        <br></br>
        <p>
          Life is tougher for people who have more power in their left hands. From cutting things with a scissor to playing cricket, everything’s a struggle for the left-handers. What about driving? Since we have right-hand cars in Pakistan, is driving harder for lefties than righties? Let’s find out.
          For years, there have been multiple studies in different countries on who are better drivers, left-handers or right-handers. Every research boils down to two things.
          Driving is harder for lefties..
          While driving a car, steering the wheel needs more control than switching gears. That means you should have your dominant hand on the steering wheel and your subordinate hand on the gears.
          Right-hand cars in Pakistan favor righties as it’s easier for them to steer the wheel with their dominant right hand. Lefties have to struggle learning to control the steering with their weaker hand.

          ≡) Regulatory Duties Up To 100% On Cars & Tyres Import Proposed
        </h4 >
        <br></br>
        <p>
          In a bid to control the economic instability and uncertainty, the government is mulling imposing high Regulatory Duties (RD) and Additional Customs Duty (ACD) on a number of items, including cars and tyres. According to media reports, the current government is preparing a revised plan to reduce imports by nearly $1 billion by increasing RD up to 100%.
          Furthermore, the suggestions were presented during a meeting chaired by Finance Minister Miftah Ismail to review the options presented by Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) and the Ministry of Commerce.

          ≡) US Dollar Going Up, Are Car Prices Too??
        </h4 >
        <br></br>
        <p>
          As one social media user wrote that the US dollar has already broken Saeed Anwar’s record of 194 and now going for Fakhar Zaman’s 210, it seems that there is nobody to control this downfall of the rupee. In the last one month or so, the US dollar has climbed from Rs. 182 to Rs. 200 in open market, which is extremely dangerous for the Pakistani economy, trade, and car market. We all know that all car companies in Pakistan import major parts, meaning the payment is in dollars; hence, the prices are directly linked to the exchange rate.
          The question is whether the car companies in Pakistan will increase the prices once again or not. It is pertinent to mention that the rates of almost all cars have been increased at least three times since January 2022. The companies have primarily blamed the dollar rate for these hikes, and we can expect another series of rate jumps in the coming days if the situation remains the same.

          ≡) Toyota Car Bookings Suspended, Once Again
        </h4 >
        <br></br>
        <p>
          Last month, Toyota Indus closed the bookings for all its car models for about two weeks. A month later, the company has suspended the bookings once again due to the same reasons of “economic uncertainty and volatile market situation”. Here are the details.
          Political and Economic Instability
          It’s been a month since the political body of Pakistan shifted gears. The new government is still adjusting to the economic situation and calculating its moves. Meanwhile, the stock market is crashing, dollar rate is going through the roof, and inflation is suffocating the masses.
          In a week, the dollar rate has climbed from 190 to an all-time high of 195.65. God forbid it crosses 200, the country’s economy will fall into pieces.
          As all car companies import major parts, they have to experience the effects of the forex rate first-hand.  The slipping of rupee puts pressure on the companies, forcing them to hike the car prices or close the order intake.
